Traditional scoring models (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting) rely heavily on structured numerical datasets but fail to incorporate contextual information from unstructured data sources such as annual reports, news sentiment, regulatory filings, and borrower communications.\nRecent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and RAG pipelines enable financial institutions to enrich predictive models with domain-specific knowledge retrieved at query time. This project aims to merge structured credit risk modeling with dynamic retrieval of textual and macroeconomic evidence."
