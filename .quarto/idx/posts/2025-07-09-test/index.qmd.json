The system leverages structured financial metrics, unstructured financial documents, and macroeconomic indicators to predict borrower risk profiles more accurately than conventional credit scoring methods. RAG is used to dynamically retrieve relevant regulatory, market, and borrower-specific text data, which is then processed alongside structured numerical features in a multimodal neural network. The approach achieves **state-of-the-art predictive accuracy** while maintaining explainability through retrieved evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\nCredit risk assessment is the cornerstone of modern banking operations. Traditional scoring models (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting) rely heavily on structured numerical datasets but fail to incorporate **contextual information** from unstructured data sources such as **annual reports, news sentiment, regulatory filings, and borrower communications**.\n\nRecent advances in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **RAG pipelines** enable financial institutions to enrich predictive models with domain-specific knowledge retrieved at query time. This project aims to **merge structured credit risk modeling with dynamic retrieval of textual and macroeconomic evidence**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Project Goal\n**Primary Objective:**  \nDevelop a **real-time, high-accuracy credit risk prediction system** that fuses structured and unstructured data using RAG and multimodal deep learning.\n\n**Key Goals:**\n- **Enhance prediction accuracy** by supplementing structured features with real-time textual evidence.\n- **Ensure explainability** via retrieved sources for each prediction.\n- **Support dynamic updates** from evolving market and borrower conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
