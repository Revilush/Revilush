## Abstract

Accurate and real-time credit risk assessment remains a cornerstone for modern banking institutions. Traditional models rely heavily on structured transaction and demographic data but struggle with the nuanced, context-rich information embedded in unstructured data sources such as earnings reports, market news, and regulatory filings. This project proposes **RiskRAG** — a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced hybrid model that integrates structured financial data with unstructured textual data to deliver **high-accuracy, real-time risk intelligence**. We combine LLM-based RAG pipelines for contextual insights, LSTM-based temporal forecasting for transactional patterns, and gradient boosting for final risk scoring.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation
Banking institutions manage risk in an environment saturated with information. Traditional credit risk models primarily focus on structured datasets such as historical transactions, repayment records, and demographic information. However, **a significant portion of relevant risk signals exists in unstructured data**: regulatory updates, press releases, earnings calls, and even social media sentiment.  
This gap can cause:

- **Lag in detecting emerging risks**
- **Over-reliance on historical data**
- **Inability to contextualize sudden events**

**RiskRAG** addresses these challenges by integrating **RAG-enhanced LLMs** to dynamically retrieve and interpret relevant external knowledge, combined with structured-data models for quantitative precision.

## 2. Related Work

- **Traditional Credit Scoring Models:** Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost approaches dominate [1].
- **LLMs in Finance:** GPT-based systems have shown promise in extracting signals from earnings calls and market news [2].
- **RAG Architectures:** Retrieval-augmented systems have improved factual grounding in domains like biomedical QA and legal research [3].
- **Hybrid Architectures:** Combining deep learning with symbolic or retrieval-based components yields higher robustness [4].

## 3. Dataset and Data Sources

### 3.1 Structured Data
- **Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection** (for transactional patterns)
- **Home Credit Default Risk Dataset** (loan application, repayment behavior)
- **UCI Bank Marketing Dataset** (customer demographics, product uptake)

### 3.2 Unstructured Data
- **SEC EDGAR**: 10-K and 10-Q filings
- **News APIs**: Bloomberg, Reuters
- **FRED API**: Macro-economic indicators
- **Twitter/X API**: Market sentiment signals

### 4.2 Components
Vector Database (FAISS or Pinecone): Stores embedded regulatory filings, news articles, and analyst reports.

RAG-Enhanced LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3 finetuned on financial QA):

Retrieves top-k relevant documents based on current customer profile & macro conditions.

Generates context-aware textual insights.

Time-Series Model (LSTM/GRU): Captures sequential dependencies in transactions and market conditions.

Fusion Layer (XGBoost/LightGBM): Combines LSTM outputs (numerical risk features) with LLM insights (vectorized text features).

Real-Time Dashboard: Risk score explanation and source documents.

## 5. Methodology
### 5.1 Data Preprocessing
Normalize transaction amounts using z-score.

Handle missing demographic data with KNN imputation.

Convert textual data into embeddings using text-embedding-ada-002 or local finetuned embeddings model.

### 5.2 RAG Retrieval Process
Query Construction: Use customer’s credit history + recent economic signals as search query.

Retriever: FAISS ANN search for top-5 documents.

Reader: LLM generates summarized context with reasoning chains.

Filtering: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure retrieved data contains relevant entities (banks, macro terms).

### 5.3 Model Fusion
Step 1: LSTM predicts short-term risk probability from transactional sequences.

Step 2: LLM generates structured feature scores (e.g., sentiment score, regulatory change severity).

Step 3: XGBoost merges structured and unstructured features into final probability.

## 6. Experiments
